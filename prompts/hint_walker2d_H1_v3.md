## Design hint

A workable structure for this robot is a walking gait with the two legs in antiphase:

- Two oscillators, one per leg, coupled so that they settle half a cycle (pi radians) apart. Each leg alternates
  stance (on the ground, pushing the body forward, thigh swinging back) and swing (knee flexed to clear the ground,
  thigh swinging forward). The phase relationship between a leg's joints is fixed by how each joint's command is
  taken from that leg's oscillator's cos and sin outputs.
- Balance feedback is added on top of the rhythm: the torso angle (obs[1]) and the torso angular velocity
  (obs[10]) feed back to the thigh joints so the torso stays upright, and forward speed is regulated through how far
  the torso leans.
