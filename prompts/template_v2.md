# Task: write a controller for a simulated system

You will write a controller for a simulated system. You cannot run code, test anything, or see any simulation
output: you get one reply, and the controller you write is scored exactly as written. Your score is the average
reward it earns in a physics simulation over many episodes.

{{TASK_SPEC}}

## Scoring

Your controller is run in 100 episodes with fixed random seeds (the seeds differ only in the tiny random
perturbation of the initial state). The score is the mean total reward per episode. Higher is better.
The controller is deterministic: the same observation always produces the same action.
